There are a couple of awesome libraries, without which this wouldn't work. In no particular order:

- [pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/) - A Python data model library that provides a simple, clean, and efficient data model for your application.
- [Jinja2](https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/) - A template engine for Python.
- [httpx](https://pypi.org/project/httpx/) - A Python HTTP client library for asyncio/sync with the familiar syntax of requests.

Also do check out the article series [Hypermodern python](https://medium.com/@cjolowicz/hypermodern-python-d44485d9d769),
which cookiecutter project was used to generate this project. Also special thanks to [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
for showing us on how to properly write documentation.
